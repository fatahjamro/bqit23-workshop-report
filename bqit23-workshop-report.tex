  10th annual conference BQIT-23 organised by Quantum Engineering Technology
  Labs (QETlabs) Universityof Bristol, Uk.

\section{Introduction}
  BQIT-23 was 10th annual quantum information technology conference organised 
  by QETLabs University of Bristol, Uk. Researchers participated and presented 
  their research work in the field of quantum technology. There were around 250
  young researchers as participants and around 40 experts speakers from academia and industry.
  Most of the speakers and participants were involved in the advanced research in quantum photonics. 
  The conference also covered topics like 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Quantum integrated photonic chips.
  \item Quantum foundation.
  \item Quantum dots.
  \item Satellite quantum communication (Photonics).
  \item Interferometry.
  \item Dark matter and gravity waves.
  \item Quantum computing.
\end{itemize}

Lab tour was also arranged where we got opportunity to see quantum integrated photonic processor,
photonic quantum refregirators, control and readout devices.

\section{Speakers}
  Many speakers were related to Photonics field
